title: Movie Recommendation!
---



### In this blog post, I’m going to make a super cool web scraper to answer the following question: **What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?**

Here’s a link to my project repository: https://github.com/M-0-N-I-C-A/Movie_Recommendation

## §1. Set up

**1.1 Locate the Starting IMDB Page**

Pick your favorite movie or TV show, and locate its IMDB page. For example, one of my favorite TV shows is Captain America: Civil War. Its IMDB page is at: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/

**1.2 Dry-Run Navigation**

Movie's IMDB page -> Cast & Crew link -> Actor's Portrait -> Filmography Section

**1.3 Initialize the Project**

Create a new GitHub repository, and sync it with GitHub Desktop. This repository will house the scraper.

Open a terminal in the location of the repository on your laptop and "scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper".

**1.4 Tweak Settings**

Add to the file settings.py: CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20 while testing out.

## §2. Write Your Scraper

Create a file inside the spiders directory called imdb_spider.py

The finished scraper looks like:


```python
# to run 
# scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv

import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/']

    def parse(self, response): 
        """
        This parse method should assume that you start on a movie page, 
        and then navigate to the Cast & Crew page. 
        """

        # Method 1: Adding Suffix to form the link for the desired next page
        suffix = "fullcredits"
        cast_crew_page = response.url+suffix
        yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits)

        # Method 2: Using developer tool to find the link of next page
            #cast_crew_url  = response.css("a.ipc-metadata-list-item__icon-link")[0].attrib["href"]
            #prefix = "https://www.imdb.com/"
            #cast_crew_page = prefix + cast_crew_page
            #yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
              

    def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        """
        This parse method should assume that you start on the Cast & Crew page.
        Its purpose is to yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page.
        """

        for suffix in [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]:
            actor_link = "https://www.imdb.com" + suffix
            yield scrapy.Request(actor_link, callback = self.parse_actor_page)


    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        """
        This parse method should assume that you start on the page of an actor. 
        It should yield a dictionary with two key-value pairs, of the form {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}.
        """

        actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()

        for movie_or_TV in response.css("div.filmo-row"):

            movie_or_TV_name = [movie_or_TV.css("a::text").get()]

            yield {
                "actor" : actor_name, 
                "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
            }
```

**The first parse method enables the user that starts on a movie page to navigate to the Cast & Crew page.
There are two methods to achieve this goal.**

**Method 1:**
This is done by acquiring the url of the current page (response.url) and attach a suffix (fullcredits) at the back to form the url of the cast and crew page. After arriving at the desired next page, we yield the response from the Request object. The first argument in Request is the URL of this request and the second argument callback is the function that will be called with the response of this request, which is, in this case, another parse method parse_full_credits.

**Method 2:**
This is done by finding out the latter part of the cast and crew page url by using developer tools and testing with scrapy shell. The url of the desired next page is then formed by attaching a prefix to it. The rest is similar to Method 1.


```python
def parse(self, response): 
    """
    This parse method should assume that you start on a movie page, 
    and then navigate to the Cast & Crew page. 
    """

    #Method 1: Adding Suffix to form the link for the desired next page
    suffix = "fullcredits"
    cast_crew_page = response.url+suffix
    yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits)

    #Method 2: Using developer tool to find the link of next page
        #cast_crew_url  = response.css("a.ipc-metadata-list-item__icon-link")[0].attrib["href"]
        #prefix = "https://www.imdb.com/"
        #cast_crew_page = prefix + cast_crew_page
        #yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

**The second parse method enables the user to yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the Cast & Crew page.**

This is done by first obtaining the latter part of the link of an actor's headshot by using response.css("td.primary_photo a").attrib["href"]. Because there are multiple actors for each movie or TV show, we can use a for loop to obtain a list of "suffixes" for each actor's page such as "/name/nm0262635/" and "/name/nm0000375/". Then, also within the for loop, we can add a common prefix "https://www.imdb.com" to each of the suffix to obtain the actual url of the actor's page. Similar to the first parse method, we yield the response from the Request object whose first argument will be the distinct URL for each actor and second argument callback will call the third parse method, parse_actor_page. 




```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    This parse method should assume that you start on the Cast & Crew page.
    Its purpose is to yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page.
    """

    for suffix in [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]:
        actor_link = "https://www.imdb.com" + suffix
        yield scrapy.Request(actor_link, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

**The third parse method assumes that the user is currecntly on a particular actor's page. It yields a dictionary of the form {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name} for each of the movies or TV shows on which that actor has worked.**

Getting the actor's name:
By using developer tools, we see that the actor's name has tag "span.itemprop" and is wrapped in the line "<span class="itemprop">Chris Evans</span>", so we can extract the text from this line by using response.css("span.itemprop::text").get().

Getting the titles of movies and TV shows:
In the Filmography section, hovering with the developer tool allows us to see that the movie or TV show's name is contained in this section below. 


```python
"""
<div class="filmo-row odd" id="actor-tt7070126">
<span class="year_column">
&nbsp;
</span>
<b><a href="/title/tt7070126/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1">Bermuda</a></b>
(<a href="https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt7070126?rf=cons_nm_filmo&amp;ref_=cons_nm_filmo" class="in_production">pre-production</a>)
<br>
Dr. Fisk (rumored)
</div>
"""
```

Therefore, we first get into this section by using response.css("div.filmo-row") to obtain a list of such sections. Then we use a for loop to apply response.css("a::text") to each section and obtained a list of items in the following form.


```python
"""
<Selector xpath='descendant-or-self::a/text()' data='Bermuda'>,
<Selector xpath='descendant-or-self::a/text()' data='pre-production'>]
"""
```

So lastly we add a .get( ) to obtain the movie or TV show's name. And also within the for loop, we yield a dictionary of the required form by inputting the actor's name and movie or TV show's name in each loop.


```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    This parse method should assume that you start on the page of an actor. 
    It should yield a dictionary with two key-value pairs, of the form {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}.
    """

    actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()

    for movie_or_TV in response.css("div.filmo-row"):
        movie_or_TV_name = [movie_or_TV.css("a::text").get()]
        
        yield {
                "actor" : actor_name, 
                "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
        }
```

After successfully implementing the above parse methods, we comment out the line "CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20" and run the command below to create a .csv file with a column for actors and a column for movies or TV shows.


```python
"""
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
"""
```

## §3. Recommendations

Once we’re happy with the operation of our spider, we can compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with your favorite movie or TV show. 


```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
results = pd.read_csv("results.csv")
results
```
