**Overall, what did you achieve in your project?**



**What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?**

1) I am especially proud of our successful implementation of the machine learning models with the most relevant input in predicting cardiovascular risk with a relatively high accuracy.

2) I am also proud of our development of the web app, which allows users to input their own data and obtain prediction result by our model.

**What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.)**

1) I think the prediction accuracy of our machine learning model could be further improved since it is currently at around 70%. This improvement could come from more patient data on cardiovascular disease and/or predicting with other machine learning models.

2) Another improvement could be to expand this prediction function to other common major diseases in addition to cardiovascular disease, since a major disease can affect the normal functionality of many organs and could potentially trigger other diseases too.

**How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)**

**What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc?**

From this project of building a cardiovascular disease risk predictor, I practiced data cleaning and visualization skills, gained experiences in applying the machine learning model learnt in class on a new data set, and also explored how to make our local web app online through heroku.


**How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.**

In general, I enjoyed working on the project as it gave us an opportunity to connect together many things we learnt in class, from data manipulation, machine learning model, to web app development, css design and so on. This valuable experience might serve as a very basic prototype that shows the kind of projects data analysts in the industry are actually working on.

Moreover, another takeaway for me is to always expect the unexpected. Our project did not go exactly as planned. We encountered difficulties that we did not think of like the initial less-than-ideal prediction accuracy and a series of problems in web app implementation, but we also managed to set a motion background for our web app interface that we did not know it was possible. Through all these pleasant (or not) surprises, I have come to understand that data science is fully of uncertainties and the best option is to embrace them. 

On top of working on my own project, I have also benefited from understanding others' projects. In retrospect, I am in awe of the breadth of topics and issues we as a class were able to cover. We have projects concerning social issues (echo chamber), minority difficulties (sign language interpretation), practical applications (differential equation solver, traffic monitor), leisure activities (music genre detection, movie recommendation), and finance (algo trading). This abundance speaks to the potential of data science in influencing all aspects in our lives without exception, a power that needs to be harnessed with caution. While the word "science" in data science seems to represent impartiality and objectivity, this is actually a subject prone to bias, as mentioned in the article "Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations". 

This also corresponds with the findings from my previous research project in collaboration with California Innocence Project, which aims to exonerate the wrongfully convicted based on their case materials and that project aimed to expedite their reviewing process through automation. Training word embedding models on only Wikipedia text corpus produced very different topic modeling results compared to training with additional various data corpora such as Twitter or even Law and Order TV show scripts. We found that the different literacy levels of the inmates were reflected in their writing, which in turn affected our model's judgement of their innocence. Therefore, it was crucial to mitigate racial, religious, and gender biases in the topic modeling results in order to give every inmate an equal chance regardless of their background. What we did was far from eliminating all biases at once, but I believe that the awarenss of the presence of bias is a very good starting point, which will also serve as a reminder, as we continue our journey in data science.
